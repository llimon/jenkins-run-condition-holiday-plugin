# Jenkins Holiday Plugin

A plugin, with which you can provide an additional Condition, so that jobs are not run on German holidays.

This is right now a pretty naive implementation, in that it only takes German holidays into account. 

This plugin is based on the fine work of [Anthony Robinson](https://github.com/jenkinsci/run-condition-plugin).
